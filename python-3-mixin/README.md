# Python Mix-in

A mix-in is a small class that only defines a set of additional methods that a class should provide. 
Mix-in classes donâ€™t define their own instance attributes nor require their ```__init__``` constructor to be called. [1]

Usually mix-in is referred as a multiple inheritance mechanism [2], but this is not precise. 
Mixin classes don't have instance attributes and don't have constructor, they do provide option to extend behavior 
without extend attributes.
